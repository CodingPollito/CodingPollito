## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**CodingPollito/CodingPollito** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Computer Science degree.  The light is now visible at the end of the tunnel (hopefully not a train).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Back-End Programming.  

- âš¡ Fun fact: This is my second degree in technology, but I wanted to get all science-y this time so I can move in a direction that better fits me.
